<p>My research project in this class is a subset of my overall research question for my masterâ€™s thesis. My thesis will look at how the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) is related to biodiversity. HANPP can be thought of as a way of quantifying the footprint that humans have on the environment. The first studies of HANPP estimated that humans co-opt about 40% of global NPP every year (Vitousek et al., 1986). Subsequent research has investigated different methods of measuring HANPP, such as including different forms of consumption into the model, but there is a consistent trend of humans using about half of the global NPP (Haberl et al., 2014). For my thesis research I will be looking at HANPP as the human consumption of crops, timber, and grazing of land. It will be the first study looking at this measurement of HANPP for each county in the U.S. This could have implications about how human land use relates to important planetary boundaries. My project for this class will be visuallizing HANPP data in the form of bar graphs for each county in the the U.S. This will help conceptualize the idea of HANPP by breaking it into its different parts as well as helping to compare HANPP across different counties.</p>

<p>The amount of net primary production (NPP) that humans use can affect the environment in different ways, but I will be focusing on how it affects biodiversity. This question falls within the framework of the species energy hypothesis, which postulates environments with more energy can support a higher number of species. For my study, energy will be measured in NPP, and I will be investigating different ways of quantifying species. There have been several studies looking at the relationship between energy and species (Cusens et al., 2012). There is generally a positive relationship between the two, although this relationship can get interrupted in instances of intensive human use (Gillman et al., 2015).</p>
<p>I plan to apply this theory to my research because HANPP can also be used to measure the amount of NPP left in an ecosystem that humans do not use. This is done through subtracting the HANPP measurement from a modeled NPP value, and the result is ecological NPP, or NPPeco. This is an estimate of the real NPP in an ecosystem that is also being used by humans. I will compare this NPPeco measurement with biodiversity to see if there is a relationship.</p>
<p>Biodiversity is a theoretical term that has many definitions, so often researchers use measurable factors that can represent biodiversity. I will be using the variables of species richness and abundance to study biodiversity. The datasets for species richness and abundance come at different scales, times, and from different sources, so I will have to figure out the abundance aspect of the data. I want to be able to identify the specific data I will use, represent it spatially, find out if there is a way to layer abundance for multiple species, and just understand these data better. I built an initial database ( <a href="database.html#database">2</a> ) structure for my tables that plan to make with my data.</p>
<p>My research question will contribute new information to the species-energy hypothesis, as well as to the idea of environmental footprints. There is a decent amount of literature about HANPP, but no one has every published anything about how HANPP affects biodiversity on a scale as large as the US. This research will also contribute to the literature about how spatial environmental factors can change greatly when portrayed at different scales, because I plan on using different data resolutions to compare results. My unique angle of looking at NPPeco and biodiversity will also contribute to the general research being done about the impacts that humans have on the environment.</p>
