# Building the database {#database}

For my project I made an SQL database in R through the R package `DBI`. 

```{r packages}
library(DBI)
```

I wanted to make this project relevant to the research that I will be doing for my thesis. However, my project is still very much in the beginning stages and I don't have all the data gathered for it yet. So what I did was make a database with 3 tables structured the way that I thought would be useful. I will eventually be making some bar graphs from the HANPP_master spreadsheet, and later on I want to do an analysis with variables in each county. That is why I chose State_county to be the primary key.

```{r image, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Schema for my database"}
knitr::include_graphics("Screenshot_database_schema.jpg")
```

First I created an R project to establish a working directory. Then within that I created a database.

```{r create database, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
hanpp_db_2 <- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), "/data/HANPP.db")
```

Next, I added tables to the database. This requires using SQL syntax and listing the name of each column and the type of variable it will be. 

```{r fill in database tables, create database, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#create main HANPP table
dbExecute(hanpp_db_2, "CREATE TABLE HANPP_main (
state_county varchar(30),
total_HANPP integer(10),
HANPP_used integer(10),
HANPP_unused integer(10),
HANPP_aboveground integer(10),
HANPP_belowground integer(10),
HANPP_total_grazing integer(10),
HANPP_total_timber integer(10),
HANPP_total_crops integer(10),
PRIMARY KEY (state_county)
);")

#create table for the county scale
dbExecute(hanpp_db_2, "CREATE TABLE NPPeco_biodiversity_county (
county_id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
state_county varchar(30),
NPPeco integer(10),
species_richness varchar(10),
abundance varchar(10),
FOREIGN KEY (state_county) REFERENCES HANPP_master(state_county)
);")

#create table for the pixel scale
dbExecute(hanpp_db_2, "CREATE TABLE NPPeco_biodiversity_pixel (
county_id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
state_county varchar(30),
NPPeco integer(10),
species_richness varchar(10),
abundance varchar(10),
FOREIGN KEY (state_county) REFERENCES HANPP_master(state_county)
);")
```

Examine tables to see if the connection worked. 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dbListTables(hanpp_db_2)
#"HANPP_main"  "NPPeco_biodiversity_county"   "NPPeco_biodiversity_pixel"

class(hanpp_db_2)
#[1] "SQLiteConnection"
#attr(,"package")
#[1] "RSQLite"

#It did work, but they are currently empty because I haven't added any of the csv data yet.
```
